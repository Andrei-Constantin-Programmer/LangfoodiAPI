# Using ADRs to formally explain all important decisions being made

## Status
Accepted

## Context
During the lifetime of the project, several important architectural decisions will be made. It is important to document them so that we can go over the history of decisions to see why a particular decision was made. This will give the other devs insight into why something is the way it is and allow us to improve on our previous decisions through hindsight.

## Decision
We have decided to implement ADRs, so that we have a history of architectural decisions.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Easily navigable records of important decisions
- Future decisions are not made in isolation
- All devs can reference those records at a later date as needed

### Negative
- There is overhead in taking important decisions, as this record must also be created
